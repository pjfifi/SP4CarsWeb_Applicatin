# SP4CarsWeb_Applicatin
Description of the project:
This project aims to understand the relationship between data and how to implement and present data on a web platform using Python and Streamlit. We aim to display a few analyses of the used vehicle markets of the world's leading vehicle manufacturers while simulating multiple data points on a web platform. 

To implement this project few a key libraries were necessary such as Streamlit and Ploty.express, Pandas Library, and Altair. 

To implement this project on your local machine, a few requirements must be satisfied:

1. A GitHub account is a requirement to be able to connect to online services such as Render in our case. Furthermore, a render account is needed to be able to host your application web browser. Render offers a free subscription service level which is more than enough for this project, but feel free to upgrade if you wish. 

2. Within your director, a few files are needed to execute this project. First and foremost, you need an app.py file which will contain your code for the application building, you will also need a database of your choosing as long as it's in CSV format. Additionally, you will need to create a file called requirement.txt which will have all the libraries listed within so the application can use the library. Lastly, you will need a configuration directory with your directory, and this this direct must be called .streamlit, and within this directory, you will create a file called config.toml.

With these requirements met you're ready to build your application. Once your app.py is ready on your local machine, save everything to your repository and commit to Github. Finally, run a final check on your terminal by typing streamlit run app.py which will generate a URL for your application. If you have done everything correctly, you should have your application launched on the web browser.
